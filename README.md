**SWE-crafter uses your LLM to automatically fix GitHub issues. Emphasizing a Test-First approach, it validates PRs with pre-written tests, providing high-quality feedback and helping the agent correct hallucinations.**

SWE-crafter explores the application of good human development practices‚Äîlike those from Extreme Programming‚Äîon autonomous agents. By integrating a Test-First methodology, SWE-crafter aims to enhance code quality and bug resolution in automated software engineering.

Benchmarks for this method are ongoing, showing promising improvements in code quality and bug resolution.
